# Hermitian Operators-Mathematica
 Theorem Proving. 
 
 I would like to learn more about using mathematica to prove mathematical theorems. 
 
 My first attempt is on the following problem:
   Given two hermitian matrices A and B, each with only positive eigenvalues, show that the trace Tr(AB) is positive.
   
So far I have not had any luck using FindEquationalProof, Assuming, Refine, or FullSimplify.
